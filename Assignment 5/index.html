        <h1>Responsive Layout Grid Systems</h1>

        <p>The Material Design responsive layout grid adapts to screen size and orientation, ensuring consistency across layouts. The Material Design layout grid is made up of three elements: columns, gutters, and margins.</p>

<h2>Columns</h2>

<p> Content is placed in the areas of the screen that contain columns. Column width is defined using percentages, rather than fixed values, to allow content to flexibly adapt to any screen size. The number of columns displayed in the grid is determined by the breakpoint range (a range of predetermined screen sizes) at which a screen is viewed, whether itâ€™s a breakpoint for mobile, tablet, or another size. On mobile, at a breakpoint of 360dp, this layout grid uses 4 columns.</p>

          <h2>Gutters</h2>
            
            <img src="https://storage.googleapis.com/spec-host-backup/mio-design%2Fassets%2F1X3yLriF6STNMsF_J-G-lPqqWxEsjSGeA%2Flayout-responsive-gutters-360.png" alt="Gutters" class="center" class="responsive"/>
            
            <p> Gutters are the spaces between columns. They help separate content. Gutter widths are fixed values at each breakpoint range. To better adapt to the screen, gutter width can change at different breakpoints. Wider gutters are more appropriate for larger screens, as they create more whitespace between columns.</p>

            <p>Margins are the space between content and the left and right edges of the screen. Margin widths are defined as fixed values at each breakpoint range. To better adapt to the screen, the margin width can change at different breakpoints. Wider margins are more appropriate for larger screens, as they create more whitespace around the perimeter of content.</p>
