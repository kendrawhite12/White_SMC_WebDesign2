            <h4> Tips for beginners:</h4>
              <p>
                Avoid planting heat-lovers like tomatoes, peppers, eggplant, cucumbers, squashes, melons, pumpkins, beans 
                (other than the fava bean which is in a different family), tomatillos, corn, or most annual herbs. Unless 
                you buy a plant that is large enough to start cropping right away, these plants will not have time to provide 
                a good harvest. Not only are the temperatures dropping at night in early autumn, but the daylight is shorter 
                and the Earth’s magnetism changes so plant life tends to start slowing making seed germination and growth slow 
                down. With longer season vegetables like most of these cool-weather growers, you will have plenty of time for 
                them to come to harvest by the end of winter or early spring. Warm season vegetables will be nipped by cold 
                before they get going if planted during second season vegetable planting in Los Angeles.
              </p>
            <br>

            <h4>Planting from Seed:</h4>
              <br>
            <p>
              These can all be planted from seed or as started plants. Root crops are best planted from seed since they don’t 
              like root disturbance. Look for some unusual varieties in seed packets or get a quick jump on the season by buying 
              larger started vegetables in bigger-sized pots.
